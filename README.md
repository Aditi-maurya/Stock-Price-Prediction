# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock price prediction is a classic problem in financial analytics, where the goal is to predict future stock prices based on historical data and other financial indicators. Predicting stock prices using deep learning is a challenging task, as stock prices are influenced by a multitude of factors including market trends, macroeconomic conditions, political events, and investor sentiment. Nevertheless, deep learning techniques—particularly those involving recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and other deep learning models—have shown promise in modeling this complex, non-linear data.This project typically focuses on predicting the closing price of a stock, which is the price at which the stock trades at the end of the trading day.
